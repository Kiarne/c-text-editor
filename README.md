## A Simple Text Editor Built from Scratch in C (Inspired by Kilo)

This project is a minimalistic text editor implemented in C, following the excellent Kilo tutorial by snaptoken. The goal of this project is to dive deep into systems programming and explore how text editors work at a fundamental level, using only the standard C library and terminal I/O.
